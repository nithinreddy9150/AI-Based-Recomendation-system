AI-Based Recommendation System
Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-based recommendation system built using collaborative filtering techniques. It employs the Mahout library to generate recommendations for users based on their interactions with content (such as ratings). The system can recommend both users and content to a given user using different algorithms, such as SlopeOne, Pearson Correlation, and Log Likelihood Similarity.

Features
User-Based Recommendation: Suggests users similar to the given user based on rating behavior.
Content-Based Recommendation: Suggests content items similar to the ones rated by the given user.
Generic Recommendations: Provides generalized recommendations based on user similarity and content similarity.
Database Integration: Uses MySQL as the backend database to store user and content ratings, which are queried to make recommendations.
Requirements
Java 8+
Apache Mahout: For collaborative filtering and recommendation algorithms.
MySQL: For storing user ratings and content ratings.
JDBC: For connecting to the MySQL database.
Log4j: For logging purposes.
Maven: For dependency management and building the project.
Libraries Used:
Mahout: For collaborative filtering and recommendation algorithms.
JDBC: For connecting to a MySQL database.
Log4j: For logging and debugging.
Apache Commons: For various utility functions.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
MySQL Setup: Ensure you have MySQL installed and running. The system expects a MySQL database with user and content ratings.

JDBC Properties: The JDBC properties file (jdbc.properties) contains the database credentials. Make sure it is placed in the resources folder and configured with your database details:

properties

jdbc.driverClassName = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
jdbc.databaseUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost/ratings
jdbc.username = root
jdbc.password = <your_password>
Database Schema: The database should have the following tables:

userRatings: This table stores the ratings given by users for different content.
contentRatings: This table stores the ratings given by users for various content items.
Building the Project
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure the required dependencies are listed in your pom.xml (Maven) or add them manually if you're using another build tool.
Build the project using Maven or your preferred build system.

mvn clean install
Running the Application
Ensure that your MySQL database is running and the tables userRatings and contentRatings are populated with data.

Run the App.java file. It will generate recommendations for a specific user (ID 45 in the example) based on the data in the MySQL database.


java -cp target/recommender-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar recommender.App
The application will output recommendations for the given user:


    USERS: [2, 7, 12, 14, ...]
    USERS_GENERIC: [3, 6, 9, 15, ...]
    CONTENT: [101, 345, 567, 112, ...]
    CONTENT_GENERIC: [205, 789, 401, 987, ...]
How It Works
Database Queries: The system connects to the MySQL database to fetch user and content ratings using the DBManager class. These ratings are stored in temporary files, which are then used for generating recommendations.

Recommendation Generation:

For user-based recommendations, the system uses user similarity metrics to find users similar to the given user.
For content-based recommendations, it suggests content that is similar to the content the user has already rated highly.
Generic recommendations are generated by calculating user and content similarity using Pearson correlation or Log-Likelihood methods.
Recommendation Algorithms:

SlopeOne: A simple and effective collaborative filtering algorithm used in the system.
Pearson Correlation: Measures the similarity between users based on their ratings using Pearson's correlation coefficient.
Log-Likelihood Similarity: A content-based similarity measure used for item recommendations.

Example Output
Running the App.java file will output a recommendation list for a specific user, such as:


    USERS: [2, 7, 12, 14]
    USERS_GENERIC: [3, 6, 9, 15]
    CONTENT: [101, 345, 567, 112]
    CONTENT_GENERIC: [205, 789, 401, 987]
The output consists of recommended users and content IDs for a given user based on their interactions.
